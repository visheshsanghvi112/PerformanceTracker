üéØ **LOCATION HANDLING FIX - CORRECT SEPARATION**
===============================================

## üîç **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**
When user said: "i sold 5 boxes to mumbai client apollo and got 5k"

**WRONG behavior (before fix):**
- Location: mumbai (GPS: Kalbadevi, Mumbai City) ‚Üê GPS mixed in!
- Live Position: Kalbadevi, Mumbai City

**CORRECT behavior (after fix):**
- Location: mumbai ‚Üê Clean business location only
- Live Position: Kalbadevi, Mumbai City ‚Üê Your current GPS location

## üí° **KEY UNDERSTANDING**
- **Location field** = Where the CLIENT/BUSINESS is (mumbai, andheri, bandra, etc.)
- **Live Position** = Where YOU are currently located (GPS coordinates)

These should **NEVER** be mixed together!

## üõ†Ô∏è **FIX APPLIED**
Modified `handlers.py` to stop contaminating the business location field with GPS data:

**Before:**
```python
# WRONG: Mixed business location with GPS
entry_data['location'] = f"{original_location} (GPS: {gps_location_str})"
```

**After:**
```python
# CORRECT: Keep business location clean, GPS goes to live position only
# GPS location will be used only for live position, not for business location
logger.info(f"üìç GPS location available for user {user.id}: {gps_location_str}")
```

## ‚úÖ **EXPECTED RESULT**
Now when you say "i sold 5 boxes to mumbai client apollo and got 5k":
- **Client:** apollo
- **Location:** mumbai ‚Üê Clean, no GPS contamination
- **Live Position:** Kalbadevi, Mumbai City ‚Üê Your actual GPS location

Perfect separation! üéØ
